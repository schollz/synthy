moomin is a polyphonic synth composed of two saw-wave oscillators per note which are mildly chorused plus a pulse-wave sub-oscillator that responds with low-note priority as a monophonic bass.

moomin has a mind of its own. the height of moomin corresponds to the filter (higher = open, smaller = closed) and naturally oscillates with a slow chaotic movement.
